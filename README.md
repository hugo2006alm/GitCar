# Unreal Traffic Simulation Project

## Overview

This Unreal Engine project is a simulation of a car following a spline path and responding to traffic lights. The goal of this project is to create a realistic traffic scenario within the Unreal Engine environment, where a car navigates along a predefined spline and adheres to traffic light signals.

## Features

1. **Spline Path Following:** The project includes a meticulously designed spline path that guides the car through a predefined route. The car is programmed to follow this spline smoothly, providing a realistic driving experience.

2. **Traffic Light System:** A fully functional traffic light system has been implemented to simulate real-world traffic scenarios. The traffic lights change dynamically, and the car responds accordingly, coming to a stop when the light is red and continuing when it turns green.

3. **Realistic Car Dynamics:** The car's movement and behavior are programmed to mimic real-world driving dynamics. The acceleration, braking, and steering are all carefully tuned to provide a convincing simulation.

4. **User-friendly Interface:** The project includes a user interface that allows users to interact with the simulation. Users can control the simulation parameters, observe the car's behavior, and customize certain aspects of the environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Unreal Engine:** Make sure you have Unreal Engine installed on your system. The project is developed using Unreal Engine [version].

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hugo2006alm/GitCar.git
2. Open the project in Unreal Engine.
3. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
4. Open the Main Scene.
5. Launch the simulation and observe the car following the spline and responding to traffic lights.

## Usage

- Use the provided user interface to customize simulation parameters.
- Observe how the car follows the spline and stops at red lights.
- Experiment with different traffic scenarios and test the car's response to varying conditions.
